# jquery.xtsaveform.js 1.1.0

jquery.xtsaveform.js 1.1.0 - https://github.com/anibalsanchez/jquery.saveform.js

Saves automatically all entered form fields, to restore them in the next visit.

Based on the original work of Yannick Albert (http://yckart.com) jquery.saveform.js 0.0.1 - https://github.com/yckart/jquery.saveform.js

I've modified the code to support "save on submit" and "restore when user come back". Also, added support for radio, select, and multi-select fields.
